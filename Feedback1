Hi,
The format of the .Rmd is cleanly organized and easier to navigate.
All code snippets worked when I tried to run them.
Kindly check if the output files for maize and teosinte data if they have the correct replacement symbols for unknown data.
When I tried to run them, I could see '?/?' in some of the output files, not sure if you see the same.
I also observe that the sorting based on increasing and decreasing order are based on the position values alphanumerically (we need numerical sorting).
The plot visualisation scripts also work fine.
The first plot also required proportion of missing data, on each-sample and each-group basis.
The readme file was self-explanatory.
Thanks for reading my review.
